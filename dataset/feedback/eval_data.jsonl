Therefore, it matches the reference image in terms of the provided textual information. **Subscore: 1**\n\n4. **Data**: The AI-generated image accurately reflects the same genre preference data as the reference image, minus the additional level of detail involving age distribution. The overall preference values and the number of genres are accurate. **Subscore: 1**\n\n5. **Style**: The AI-generated image attempts to mimic the reference chart’s style by using percentage labels with white, bold text within the pie sections. However, it misses other stylistic elements such as the wedgeproperties (e.g., width of the wedges) and the central circle that makes the chart look like a doughnut chart. The additional nested pie charts style-wise also contributes significantly to the visual appeal, which is missing. **Subscore: 1**\n\n6. **Color**: The AI-generated image lacks the specific colors (genre_colors and age_colors) intended in the reference chart which required defined specific palettes. This alteration means the AI-generated image falls short in matching the intended visual palette of the reference. **Subscore: 0**\n\nFinal score: **4**", "metadata": {"file_list": ["./dataset/example/initialization/00071.png", "./dataset/variants/initialization/00071_path_2_stage_2.png"]}}

Subscore: 1.\n\n5. **Style**: The AI-generated code lacks many of the stylistic elements that make the reference chart visually clear and informative. Missing elements include text settings for the auto text (size, weight, and color), the explode effect’s specifications, the center circle for the donut effect, the legend, and the shadow effect. These stylistic components are essential to the overall presentation of the chart and are required to fully match the reference. Subscore: 0.\n\n6. **Color**: The AI-generated code does not match the reference code in terms of colors. The reference colors are not specified in the provided snippet, but it is clear that the AI-generated code uses placeholder colors that do not match any predefined list from the reference. Thus, it fails to replicate the color scheme that would be important for an accurate comparison.

{"question_id": "03032_path_1_stage_1", "instruction": "You are an excellent judge at evaluating visualization chart plots.\n### Task:\nThe AI-generated image is created using matplotlib code generated by a visual language model, and the reference image is created using ground truth matplotlib code. Your task is to score how well the AI-generated image matches the ground truth image.\n\n### Scoring Methodology:\nThe AI-generated image's score is based on the following criteria, totaling a score out of 6 points:\n\n1. **Chart Types (1 point)** Does the AI-generated image include all chart types present in the reference image (e.g., line charts, bar charts, etc.)?\n2. **Layout (1 point)** Does the arrangement of subplots in the AI-generated image match the reference image (e.g., number of rows and columns)?\n3. **Text Content (1 point)** Does the AI-generated image include all text from the reference image (e.g., titles, annotations, axis labels), excluding axis tick labels?\n4. **Data (1 point)** Does the data trends in the AI-generated image accurately resemble those in the reference image and is the number of data groups the same as in the reference image?\n5. **Style (1 point)** Does the AI-generated image match the reference in terms of marker types (point shapes, line styles, etc.), legends, grids, and other stylistic details?\n6. **Color (1 point)** Does the AI-generated image match the reference in terms of colors (line colors, fill colors, etc.)?\n\n### Evaluation:\nCompare the two images head to head, assign a score of 1 or 0 for each dimension and sum them up. Provide a few lines for explanation and the rate number at last after “Final Score:”.", "response": "1. **Chart Types**: The AI-generated image correctly includes both a bar chart and a line plot with two lines, consistent with the reference image. Thus, the chart types perfectly match the reference.  \n   Subscore: 1\n\n2. **Layout**: The layout of the AI-generated image matches the reference image, comprising two subplots arranged in a 1-row, 2-column format. This layout is executed correctly.  \n   Subscore: 1\n\n3. **Text Content**: The AI-generated image includes all text content from the reference image, including titles, axis labels, and annotations for the bar heights. It captures the text content exactly as required.  \n   Subscore: 1\n\n4. **Data**: The data trends in the AI-generated image accurately resemble those in the reference image. All data groups, including solar, wind, and hydro energy values, as well as total renewable energy and percentage growth, are represented correctly.  \n   Subscore: 1\n\n5. **Style**: The AI-generated image matches the reference in terms of marker types, line styles, legends, and grid lines. All stylistic details including line markers (circles and crosses), dashed lines for percentage growth, and legends' positioning and content are captured accurately.  \n   Subscore: 1\n\n6. **Color**: The colors for the bars in the AI-generated image have been manually changed to green (solar energy), orange (wind energy), and blue (hydro energy). Although the instruction was to shuffle the colors without using any external libraries or randomization functions, the final output does not match the original reference colors used. Therefore, the color criterion is not fully satisfied.  \n   Subscore: 0\n\nFinal score: 5", "metadata": {"file_list": ["./dataset/example/initialization/03032.png", "./dataset/variants/initialization/03032_path_1_stage_1.png"]}}
