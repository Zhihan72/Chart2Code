Since randomness is involved, we will shuffle the consumption data within each type while maintaining the same structure (i.e., preserving weekly data points but changing their values).\n\n2. Use NumPy's `numpy.random.permutation` method to shuffle the data, thereby avoiding using the `random` library.

This shuffling retains the dimensional integrity of the data arrays but distributes values randomly within each dataset.\n- The plotting logic remains unchanged, so the altered data is visualized in the same structural style as before.

Specifically, `ax.set_ylim(0, 35)` became `ax.set_xlim(0, 35)` consistent with the horizontal orientation.\n\n4. **Annotation Adjustment**: \n   - The position for annotations was adjusted using `xytext` and horizontal/vertical alignment (`ha` and `va`), ensuring the percentage labels are correctly placed alongside each horizontal bar.

The `ax.plot()` calls have been removed because they plot the outline lines of the radar chart, which are not necessary for a filled-area style as per the direction.\n2. **Category Labels**: As we are focusing on the fill, keeping the categories hidden aligns with the original instructions and was left unchanged to preserve design consistency. However, if labels were needed, they can be added back by replacing `ax.set_xticklabels([])` with `ax.set_xticklabels(categories)`.\n3. **Redundant Comments Removed**: Comments that only explained straightforward code actions, like data declarations, were removed to focus on code readability and functionality."

This setup makes the plot visually dynamic and unique.\n   \n2. **Grids and Borders**: The grid now displays with a specific linestyle and reduced opacity to ensure it doesn't overpower the plotted data. While previously the radial plot border wasn't explicitly set to visible, it now always shows to enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Legend Positioning**: The legend is modified to appear outside the plot, ensuring it doesn't clutter the radar chart and is easily readable.

This generates indices we use to reorder the years, temperatures, and respective errors.\n  \n- **Bar Chart Plotting:** We replace the `errorbar` line plot with a `bar` plot for sorted temperatures on the first subplot.

Bar widths are adjusted to make sure bars for different energy types in a specific decade are adjacent.\n- **Legend**: Since every energy type needs a separate legend entry, each source type is given a label only once during the first iteration.\n- **Bar Positioning**: Using `x_offset` for each continent ensures that bars for each continent start at a non-overlapping position."

Medians received an increased linewidth and changed color.\n\n4. **Line Plot**: The average potency line now uses `marker='d'` with a dashed line style (`linestyle='--'`) and a new color (`blue`) to randomly alter from the previous continuous line.\n\n5. **Title and Labels**: Modifications were made in terms of size and weight for the title and axis labels for a slightly more subdued presentation.\n\n6. **Gridlines**: Changed from the `x` to `y` axis and updated linestyle to `-..` along with a reduced alpha value for subtler gridlines.\n\n7. **Legend**: The legend was simplified to include only two components\u2014'Avg Potency' and 'Median'\u2014with a new position at the `upper center` and with the frame visible.\n\n8. **Visual Insets**: Changes in tick label alignment (`ha='left'`) and increased numeral font size contribute to the stylistic overhaul.

This is done using `np.argsort(space_revenue)[::-1]`, which provides indices to sort the revenue in descending order.\n2. **Plotting Bar Chart**: We use a single bar chart to plot the sorted revenues against the years. This clearly shows the progression of revenue without the overlapping line and bar chart elements from the previous code.\n3. **Legend and Title**: The legend and title were adjusted to focus solely on the revenue component, reflecting the changes in the visualization approach.\n\nThese changes highlight the sequence of revenue generation, focusing purely on monetary progression rather than tourist numbers plotted over time."

This change alters the orientation of the bars from vertical to horizontal.\n   \n2. **Labels Adjustments**: Since the orientation changed, the placement and alignment of the labels need to be adjusted. The `ax.text()` method now sets its position based on `bar.get_width()` for labels and uses the horizontal center calculated from `bar.get_height()`.\n\n3. **Axis Labels Swap**: The x-axis and y-axis labels are exchanged to match the new orientations typical for a horizontal bar chart, where the labels for numerical values (tourists) are set on the x-axis, and categorical labels (wonders) on the y-axis.\n\n4. **Ticks Adjustment**: Changed y-axis ticks rotation to 0 for better readability since wonder names are now aligned vertically.\n\n5. **Grid Lines and Spines**: The grid and spine settings were preserved but adapted to reflect the chart's current orientation without unnecessary changes.\n\nThe above adjustments result in a horizontal bar chart representation of the same data."

It was chosen to give a visually balanced donut shape.\n\n3. **Axis Equalization**: \n   - `ax.axis('equal')` ensures that the donut chart is drawn as a circle by maintaining equal aspect ratios. This is crucial for aesthetics, as any distortion might skew the perception of the data.\n\n4. **General Updates**:\n   - The rest of the code remains largely unchanged, keeping labels, titles, legends, and layout adjustments as they effectively communicate the data distribution."

To transform this into a diverging bar chart, we typically represent both positive and negative data contributions starting from a central axis. A diverging bar chart is 2D, and each category will have bars extending in opposite directions to indicate the contribution of various species. Generally, one axis is used to list categories, and the other to quantify a measure (such as percentage).\n\nFirst, we analyze the data structure:\n- We have species data for different habitats over several years.\n\nLet's change this to a 2D diverging bar chart reflecting changes in biodiversity by positive and negative contributions from the species data. Here's the altered code:\n\nChanged code:\n\n\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **2D Conversion**: We replaced the 3D plotting with a horizontal bar chart (`barh`), which better suits the diverging bar chart type.\n2. **Divergence from Center**: Bars are stacked horizontally, and each stack represents the cumulative effect of one species across the years.\n3. **Avoiding 3D Complexity**: The information redundancy in 3D is eliminated (since we no longer visualize each year distinctly but instead sum across them), providing a clear and concise visual insight into contribution trends by species.\n4. **Legend and visualization**: We maintain clear labels for species and habitats, ensuring the chart clearly communicates the intended insights.\n\nThis design choice reflects the intended representation of multi-directional data contribution, which diverging bar charts usually highlight."

The labels have been used to show the genre names, and an autopct to provide percentage values.\n\n3. **Simplified Layout**: By focusing solely on the overall preferences, the code is more straightforward, making the resultant pie chart a standard format pie chart. This aligns with the request to convert it to a \"base pie chart\".\n\nThe revised code thus provides a general view of genre preferences without delving into sub-categories like age distribution."

In a horizontal bar chart, data is represented with horizontal bars, typically used when labeling or comparing different categories can be challenging with a vertical bar chart.\n\nHere's how the changed plotting code looks:\n\nChanged code:\n\n\n\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Horizontal Bar Chart**: \n   - The `scatter` plots have been replaced with `barh` to create horizontal bars. This simulates categories (here, `star_ages`) being plotted against the count of exoplanets.\n   - The `range(len(star_ages))` acts as the y-coordinates for the bars, which represent each category along the vertical axis of the bar chart.\n   - Colors and transparency are adjusted using colormap objects to keep visual distinction between the groups.\n\n2. **YAxis and Ticks**:\n   - `set_yticks` and `set_yticklabels` convert the default numerical tick values to `star_ages`, labeling the y-axis accurately against these categories.\n\n3. **Shared X-Axis for Lines**:\n   - We replace separate y-axes scatter/link visuals with a shared twinned x-axis plot using `twiny`. It uses the value of brightness against the star ages index for both groups.\n   - `plot` is used instead of smoothing functions (`make_interp_spline`) as we are visualizing already detailed data such as brightness lines on the horizontal scale.\n\n4. **Legends**:\n   - Added legends to give context for color-coded groups and brightness lines.\n\nThis approach creates a blend of clear horizontal bar representation for exoplanet counts and superimposes brightness lines for a detailed visual comparison between group data."

We restructured this data to plot 'adoption' as positive values and 'non-adoption' as their symmetric negatives onto the same axis to achieve the diverging effect.\n\n2. **Bar Positioning**: Instead of stacking, the bars were aligned at the center (y=0) by plotting each with its respective negative counterpart for a diverging style.\n\n3. **Visual Adjustments**: We set the x-axis limits from -100 to 100 to align the visual weight around a central zero line, representing balance. This provides a better symmetrical visual structure to analyze changes.\n\n4. **Legend and Styling**: Legend labels are adjusted and formatted to clarify which year each adoption and non-adoption bar represents, enhancing interpretability.\n\nThis implementation dynamically conveys the adoption performance of each technology across years by visualizing both the portion adopted and the segment not adopted, broken out in diverging sections from a central line."

By referencing them with `(ax2, ax1)` instead of `(ax1, ax2)`, the subplot for the \"Share of Energy Sources\" is moved to the right, and the \"Total Energy Consumption\" is moved to the left.\n\n2. **Consistency in Code:** After swapping, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that the actions performed on the subplots remain consistent with their new positions.

We will create index positions for each group and adjust each bar's position within those. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\nChanged code:\n\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Bar Positions:** Since we're creating a grouped bar chart, we calculate each bar's position by using the `x_positions` array with offsets for each funding source (`i * bar_width`). This ensures the bars for each funding source are aligned side-by-side within each discipline category.\n\n2. **Bar Width:** `bar_width` is used to determine how wide each individual bar should be. Adjusting this value affects the space between groups of bars.\n\n3. **X-ticks Adjustment:** The x-ticks are adjusted to be the center of each grouped set of bars. We achieve this by calculating the mid-point of all bars in each group using the expression `x_positions + bar_width * (len(funding_sources) - 1) / 2`.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code transforms from a stacked to a grouped bar chart, maintaining visual clarity and providing a clear comparison of each funding source across disciplines."

They indicate energy generation values for different sources across continents.\n\n3. **Plot Setup**:\n    - We use `plt.subplots()` to create a 2D plot with a single axis for a clearer separation between the two-dimensional grouped bar chart and the previously used 3D plotting.\n    - `bar_width` defines the width of each bar.\n\n4. **Plotting Bars**:\n    - We use a loop to plot each category of the energy source next to each other on the same axis. This creation of grouped bars is achieved by adding `i * bar_width` to `x_indices` ensuring the bars for different energy sources are adjacent per continent. This shifts each group of bars slightly to position them next to each other.\n  \n5. **Axes and Legend**:\n    - X-axis represents continents; Y-axis represents energy generation.\n    - The legend distinguishes which color represents which energy source.\n    - Axes ticks and labels are set for clarity.\n\nThe overall transition from a 3D bar to a grouped 2D bar chart improves readability and meets the specified direction."
